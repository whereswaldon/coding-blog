My senior seminar class requires that I start a blog. I must confess, I've never been able to keep up with a blog. However, if I'm going to have a blog, I want it to be worth reading. I'll try to work assigned posts and topics into my content, but not let them dominate. Hopefully, these posts will be worth reading.

In this post, I'd like specifically to talk over a couple of past programming projects. I've worked on a lot of projects in the seven years since I started programming in high school. Many of those projects were homework for school, and a lot of them felt pointless. However, I've had one school project that really felt good to complete. A year and a half ago, I took the programming languages class at my university. We learned formal grammars and the functional, and declarative paradigms of programming. While functional programming has been an incredibly useful technique to know, I think the best thing that I learned from that class was how to write a simple interpreter for a low-level language called WIC. Don't get me wrong, WIC wasn't very cool as a language. It was simple, with the expressiveness of assembly langugage and the execution speed of flowing ketchup. What it taught me, though, was invaluable. I could define an arbitrary language, and I could take that langauage from an idea to an actual, usable, executable language. I'm not sure whether I'll ever have cause to define my own language, but knowing that I can is an incredible confidence boost.

Outside of class, I've been working at a web development company for the last year and a half. I took an intrest in live form validation on the client side, and I tried to develop a small javascript project that would provide instantaneous feedback to users when they did or did not type valid input. That turned out to be a deeper hole than I expected, and it's now [my most-worked-on project on github](https://github.com/whereswaldon/backfeed). It's not production-ready yet, as I keep finding new cases that it could handle more elegantly, but I've gained immense satisfaction from trying it out on my own projects, and it's helped me feel more confident in my understanding of the DOM and javascript.

I'm sorry if the above felt forced. It certainly didn't come out fluently. I guess my writing muscles are cramping from lack of use. I'll try to stretch them more, and hopefully the next post will be worth your time.
