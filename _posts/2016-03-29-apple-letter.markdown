Apple's recent PR move has caused quite the stir in my
computational circles. While there's something of a concensus among
my friends that Apple's move to protect the data of its customers
is the direction that we want them to take, many of my friends
think that Apple's letter is nothing more than a publicity
stunt to attempt to garner more manic customer loyalty.

I've also been told that both Apple and the FBI could just
jailbreak the phone to get the data, and that they are simply
unwilling to pursue that option. I can understand, to an extent,
why Apple doesn't want to endorse jailbreaking their devices,
but I cannot fathom why the FBI would have a single scruple about
doing so. Jailbreaking isn't illegal anymore. I suspect that 
there must be some kind of mistake regarding the effectiveness of
jailbreaking a maximum-security iPhone, but a member of my class
did claim to have done it himself.

Regardless of whether or not cracking the phone is technically possible,
I'm glad that Apple took this stance. The court order that tried to
force them to write a backdoor into their own high-security code would
have set a terrible precedent. I think that's the first instance that
I've ever heard of in which a court ordered a company to produce a product.
Usually the demands of a court order are simply releasing information,
but this would have been hundreds of man-hours on Apple's part that would
serve only to cripple their product.

I don't particularly want to be a programmer in a world where the
I can be forced to compromise my own product at the whims of my
governing authority. I want to be a software developer for the rest of
my life, and I never want to be put in that position myself.
