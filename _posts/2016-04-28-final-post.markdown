This semester has been a relatively transformative one for me.
I learned that networking has enormous power to further one's
career (I recieved two job offers that were initially social
leads, rather than formal applications).

I learned that the
NSA has done some really terrible things and that Edward Snowden
is an impressive human being. His courage in disclosing what
he discovered at the NSA still floors me, especially given
the totally realistic expectations that he had about the
consequences of his actions. The most touching part of it
to me was that he didn't tell any of his family or his
girlfriend what he was doing, even though he knew it meant
that he might be separated from them for years.

The third major thing that I learned this semeseter was a result
of some of my own research. I learned about how Snowden was able
to communicate so securely with journalists, and I learned that
it's actually fairly easy. To that end, I'm working to set up that
kind of encryption on all of my devices. Now that I understand
the important role that strong encryption plays in the lives of
human rights activists everywhere, I'd like to help protect them
by adding to the total volume of encrypted traffic through the
internet.

A class asked me to write these blog posts, and as part of the final
post I'm supposed to give advice to the next group of students to take
this class. I would advise them to find a research area for their
class presentations that is of personal interest and to dive in early.
I wish I'd had longer to experiment with encryption. It would have been
cool to be able to give a demo of how it works to my class when I spoke
about it in a presentation. The kind of thing that I learned by doing
my research is practical and life-changing, and I can't encourage people
enough to try it.
