In one of my classes, we recently had a guest lecture by a
retired digital security professional. It was enlightening.
I've never really thought about how the security issues that
I am accustomed to dealing with in my day-to-day have evolved
essentially during my lifetime. Web security is younger than the
web itself, which is younger than me. Modern, well-understood
security practices had to be developed as I grew up.

The speaker who visited our class was part of that generation
of developers who had to figure it all out, and his perspective
was interesting. Unfortunately, he assumed that his audience
were less technical than my class of senior-year computer
scientists actually are, and he omitted some technical
details that I would really have liked to know.

He was surprisingly transparent about the data breaches that
have occurred during the course of his career, including one
that occurred right before his retirement (though it was unrelated
to him retiring). I think that the most interesting aspect
of his story was actually that the development staff knew about
the breach for over a month before he (as HEAD of security) heard
anything about it. There was also some kind of beaurocracy with
getting the software patch into place on the live service that
was affected that led to the vulnerability existing (and being
exploited) for something like six continuous weeks before being resolved.
I don't really understand why they didn't take the service down
temporarily after finding the vulnerability, but I guess (since
the problem was with an online store) it can be chalked up to
corporate greed. God forbid we lose a week of sales to preserve
our customers' information.

Anyway, I really did enjoy the talk. It presented a side of the industry
with which I am not familiar. I would definitely be interested in
future guest lectures in this class.
