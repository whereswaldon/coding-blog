Recently, a representative from my university's
career development center visited one of my classes
to talk about how to appropriately plan for the future
as a person in the computer science field. I must admit,
I haven't really been worrying about it recently. I'm
looking to get into grad school and I have a job in the
programming industry already. However, in the last
couple of days I have been forced to examine the possibility
of not getting into grad school. I can't actually 100%
plan on that happening, but I've rather neglected alternative
plans.

If I get in to grad school, I'll just finish up that degree
and then start my job search for something relatively close
to home. However, if I fail to get in, I guess I need to
either plan to work at my current employer for another year
or look for alternative employment much sooner. The uncertainty
is a little scary.

The main takeaway that I had from the presentation that I saw
in class was actually a nostalgic reflection on how quickly
technology changes. The presentation was tailored to a technical
audience, but had not been updated since Windows 3.1 was a relevant
skill in the modern business world. It made me think about growing
up with Windows 95 and 98. I discovered some of my favorite video
games ever (not that I'm much of a gamer) on Windows 98. I realized
just how much I miss that silly space pinball game that ships with
older Windows OSes.

Actually, I think I'll just go see if I can run that pinball game
on Linux with Wine. Until next time...
