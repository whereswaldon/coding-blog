Randy Pausch's Last Lecture has had an enormous impact
on many viewers. I'd heard of "The Last Lecture" long
before I saw it, and even while I was watching Randy
talk, I didn't realize that I was seeing the lecture
that everybody had told me about. I was watching the
lecture in a Computer Science class, and I assumed
that, because Randy was a Computer Scientist, this was
a last lecture in my field rather than THE Last Lecture.

Randy's message was powerful. I have a number of dreams
that I hold on to that originated as a child. For instance,
I've always wanted to work for or with NASA. October Sky
was my favorite film for a long time, and my mother read
Rocket Boys to my siblings and I while we were preteens.
I'm not sure that I've ever been as inspired by another
story. Holmer Hickam and Co. were everything that I
ever wanted to be. It was a sad day when I realized that,
due to my poor eyesight, I was ineligible as both a pilot
and an astronaught. Since those paths were closed to me,
I settled for something a little less impossible: being
on the team of scientists and engineers responsible for
the space missions. For a while, I really wanted to
program for NASA, but I worry that their standards
would forever ruin programming for me. Why? I read
[this article](https://www.fastcompany.com/28121/they-write-right-stuff)
about how NASA handles programming for the Space Shuttle
systems. I think that their standards are amazing, but
I know that they aren't practiced in industry because
they're [too expensive](https://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/sapm/2014/03/14/we-could-write-nearly-perfect-software-but-we-choose-not-to/)
.

At this point in my career, I still would enjoy working
for NASA, but I really have no idea in what capacity.
I don't have the physics or C programming background
to work in the space industry. However, Randy has encouraged
me to be optimistic. Maybe in the course of my career, I'll
have the chance to work with NASA. When and if that happens,
I hope I have the tenacity that Randy did when working
out his deal with Disney.
