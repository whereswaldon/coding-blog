Not too long ago in my Senior Seminar at college, my professor
asked the class to discuss security and/or privacy concerns with
his beekeeping website [Hivetracks](https://hivetracks.com/login.php).

The class addressed many issues related to how the site stores
and uses the data of the many beekeepers who employ Hivetracks to
(forgive the useage of the word) "track" their beehives. As it turns
out, Hivetracks is a fairly above-board enterprise. They don't resell
user data to third parties, nor do they drown their users in advertising
to pay their expenses. He was also surprisingly honest about the only
security issues that the site has ever experienced. While one of them
was severe, it was addressed professionally and is no longer an issue.
The fact that he's willing to discuss it instead of pretending that
the site is perfect is impressive, and is not a strategy that most
software businesses employ.
