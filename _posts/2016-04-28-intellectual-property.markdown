The son of one of my professors is a lawyer who also has a degree in
Computer Science, and he recently gave a presentation on intellectual
property targeted at computer scientists. His talk was interesting,
and it helped me internalize the meanings of several different terms
that are commonly bandied about when discussing intellectual property.

- Patents
  - Protecting an idea or process. This gets the idea/technique into
  the public domain by rewarding the inventor with a limited-term
  monopoly on the use of their invention. The tradeoff between
  the legal monopoly and releasing your technique to the public domain
  never made sense to me before, but it makes total economic sense to
  handle invetions that way. It ensures that good ideas are shared,
  even if they can't be used immediately.
- Trademarks
  - Up until this lecture, I've never once felt like I understood what
  a trademark is or what one does. Apparently, trademarks are used to
  protect the identity of a business. By trademarking your branding,
  you protect your customers from other businesses attempting to
  mimic your brand in order to steal their business. A high-quality
  product with good branding can be quite valuable as a brand, even
  without physical assets (e.g. Coca-Cola).
- Copyrights
  - Copyrights are the only part of this whole intellectual
  property mess that have historically made sense to me. Any creative
  work on my part has an implicit copyright making it mine, though
  I can't enforce that right unless I register my copyright with the
  government.
- Trade Secrets
  - Finally, trade secrets are things like the Heinz ketchup recipe
  or the Coke recipe (or Google's Algorithms for searches) that
  are held secret (by nondisclosure agreements) so that a company can
  maintain its edge over its competitors. If patents didn't have
  the limited monopoly, it's likely that all new inventions would
  be trade secrets until someone figured them out.
  
On the whole, the lecture really clarified what these different terms
mean to me. I'm glad to have attended.
